# Covid-19_Assisstant_App

This project was done during a the Covid-19 Pandemic where I came up with creative solutions to make any college campus Covid Free. I first did a need assessment considering different problems students might face upon reopening the college in the pandemic. I then came up with the idea to make an application to solve the problems identified. This app relies on user reported data to keep track of people not following rules & regulation, unsanitized places and a daily log of places visited & people met.
